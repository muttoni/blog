Hi, thanks for taking the time to visit my blog. If you don't know me, my name is Andrea Muttoni. Over the last 6 years I've been working at Amazon where I've covered all sorts of roles: from Kindle book pricing, to Technical Product Management and more recently Solution Architecture / Technical Evangelism. Prior to Amazon, I co-founded a software development agency mainly focused on the creative sector where I had the immense opportunity to learn several roles at once: software engineering, UI/UX design, sales and product management. In a world of specialists, I am an undying generalist, with a bad habit of diving into new things and trying to learn them inside out (and often failing).

Combining technology with creativity is something that never ceases to intrigue me. I started this blog to document at least a small fraction of the adventures that I embark on exploring the bottomless wonders of technology (and music). Two areas where I will always feel like a Morty[^1], inspired and dragged along by all the genius Ricks of the world.

### Main areas of interest

- Technical Product Management
- Fullstack Development (From UI/UX design to actually implementing JS components and backend APIs)
- Public speaking & Developer Relations
- Machine Learning
- Music production
- Anything that combines any of the above.

### Experience

**Technical Experience**: I have worked on all sorts of software projects over the years: full-stack web applications, browser extensions, physical server administration, cloud-based serverless API development, crawlers, machine learning models. I enjoy keeping up with new technologies, as it helps me discover new ways to tackle a problem, or appreciate "boring" solutions even more...win-win! HN is my NYT. Writing code for me is a means to an end -- the real objective is creating something that's usable and beautiful (in that order). For me, that flow that makes one effortlessly focus for days on end without distractions comes from two things: building things and composing music.

**Business Experience**: Not that you asked, but I don't believe in "business" vs. "tech". I think the world would be a better place if everyone had some technical skills: people would be more efficient and more in tune with what a machine can accomplish (as opposed to getting frustrated or giving up on _the damn computer_ altogether!). I also believe the world (and countless work environments) would be a better place if engineers were more integrated into the business process. With that out of the way, my main business experience is focused around all the facets of product management, which I have done for several years at Amazon. My ideal product management role would have oversight on all the aspects of a software product: UX/UI (in that order), API design, Developer documentation and of course software architecture and functionality. The world needs more technical business people! (or business-y tech people, if you prefer)

**Misc**: I also really enjoy public speaking. As a Tech Evangelist for Amazon, I spoke at more than 300 events in all shapes and sizes: keynotes with thousands of people, all the way to small hands-on coding workshops with 20 developers. When COVID subsides, I'd love to pick up speaking again. Digital events are just not the same. Notable speaking engagements: AWS re:Invent, Web Summit, IFA Berlin, Droidcon, Codemotion, Codetalks Hamburg, Cambridge University, Imperial College London, Euroconsumer, University College London, Alexa developer workshops in USA, England, Ireland, Scotland, Germany, Italy, Spain and hundreds of other events! Tech conferences are just awesome, especially for the communities that are born around them. 

If you've had enough of my blabbering and prefer a traditional CV, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muttoni/).
