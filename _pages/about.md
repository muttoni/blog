Hi, thanks for taking the time to visit my blog. If you don't know me, my name is Andrea Muttoni. Over the last 6 years I've been working at Amazon and I've covered all sorts of roles: from Kindle book pricing, to Technical Product Management and more recently Tech Evangelism. Prior to that I co-founded a software development agency focused on the media and the arts. Combining technology with creativity is something that never ceases to intrigue me.

I started this blog to document at least a small fraction of the adventures that I embark on exploring the bottomless wonders of technology and music. Two areas where I will always feel like a Morty[^1], inspired and dragged along by all the genius Ricks of the world.

### Main areas of interest

- Machine Learning
- Music production
- Technical Product Management
- Public speaking & Developer Relations
- Anything that combines any of the above.

### Experience

**Technical Experience**: I have worked on all sorts of software projects over the years. From developing full-stack web applications, to creating browser extensions, physical server administration, cloud-based serverless API development, etc. I still have a TON to learn though, and I enjoy trying (and often failing) to keep up with all the latest trends. Writing code for me is a means to an end -- the real objective is creating. That feeling of flow that makes me effortlessly focus for days on end without distractions comes only from two things: building things that help people get stuff done, and composing music.

**Business Experience**: I don't believe in "business" vs. "tech". I think the world would be a better place if everyone had technical skills, as people would be more efficient and more in tune with what a machine can accomplish (as opposed to getting mad at the machines or giving up on them altogether!). I also believe the world (and many work environments) would be a better place if engineers were more integrated into the business process. With that out of the way, my main business experience is focused around all the facets of product management, which I have done for several years at Amazon. My ideal product management role would have oversight on all the aspects that make a software product: UX/UI (in that order), API specs, Developer Documentation and of course software architecture and functionality. 

**Misc**: I also enjoy public speaking. As a Tech Evangelist for Amazon, I have spoken at more than 300 events in all shapes and sizes: keynotes with thousands of executives, all the way to small hands-on coding workshops with 20 developers. When COVID subsides, I'd love to pick up speaking again. Digital events are just not the same. Notable speaking engagements: AWS re:Invent, Web Summit, IFA Berlin, Droidcon, Codemotion, Codetalks Hamburg, Cambridge University, Imperial College London, Euroconsumer, University College London, Alexa developer workshops in USA, England, Ireland, Scotland, Germany, Italy, Spain and hundreds of other events! Tech conferences are just awesome, especially for the communities that are born around them. 

If you've had enough of my blabbering and prefer a traditional CV, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muttoni/).
