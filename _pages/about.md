Hi, thanks for taking the time to visit my blog. If you don't know me, my name is Andrea Muttoni. Over the last 6 years I've been working at Amazon and I've covered all sorts of roles: from Kindle book pricing, to Technical Product Management and more recently Tech Evangelism.

My biggest passion is exploring the bottomless wonders of technology and music. Two areas where I will always feel like a Morty[^1], inspired and dragged along by all the genius Ricks of the world.

**Main areas of interest**: 
- Technical Product Management
- Public speaking & Developer Relations
- Machine Learning
- Music production
- Anything that combines any of the above.

**Experience**:
- I have practical coding proficiency in various programming stacks, mainly NodeJS and web development. Over the years, I've built various services, tools, and browser extensions. For Machine Learning, mainly Python.
- I have spoken at more than 300 events in all shapes and sizes: keynotes with thousands of executives, all the way to small hands-on coding workshops with 20 developers. Notable speaking engagements: AWS re:Invent, Web Summit, IFA Berlin, Droidcon, Codemotion, Codetalks Hamburg, Cambridge University, Imperial College London, Euroconsumer, University College London, Alexa workshops in USA (Seattle), UK/IE (England, Ireland, Scotland), Germany (Berlin, Cologne, Frankfurt), Italy, Spain and hundreds more! .
- For a traditional CV, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muttoni/).
