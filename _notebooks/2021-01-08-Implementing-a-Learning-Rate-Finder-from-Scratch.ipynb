        "## Understanding the Learning Rate\n",
        "\n",
        "Before we start, what _is_ the learning rate? The learning rate is just a value we multiply our gradients by in Stochastic Gradient Descent before updating our parameters with those values. Think of it like a \"weight\" that reduces the impact of each step change so as to ensure we are not over-shooting our loss function. If you imagine our loss function like a parabola, and our parameters starting somehwere along the parabola, descending along by a specific amount will bring us further \"down\" in the parabola, to it's minimum point eventually. If the step amount is too big however, we risk overshooting that minimum point. That's where the learning rate comes into play: it helps us achieve very small steps if desired.\n",
        "\n",
        "To refresh your memory, here is what happens in the optimization step of Stochastic Gradient Descent ([Part 1]({% post_url 2020-12-28-Implementing-a-Deep-Neural-Network-from-Scratch-Part-1 %}) of our DNN series explains this formula in more detail, so read that first):\n",
        "\n",
        "$ w := w - \\eta \\nabla Q({w}) $\n",
        "\n",
        "Our parameter $w$ is updated by subtracting its gradient calculated with respect to the loss function $\\nabla Q({w})$ after multiplying it by a weighing factor $\\eta$. That weighing factor $\\eta$ is our learning rate!\n",
        "\n",
        "It's even easier in code:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# part of the .step() method in our SGD_Optimizer\n",
        "for p in self.parameters: p.data -= p.grad.data * self.lr\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This is outlined in the `.step` method of our optimizer (check the setup code in the next section).\n",
        "As we saw towards the end of [Part 2]({% post_url 2021-01-01-Implementing-a-Deep-Neural-Network-from-Scratch-Part-2 %}) of our Implementing a Deep Neural Network from Scratch series, the learning rate has a _big_ impact on training for our model: the lower the learning rate, the more epochs required to reach a given accuracy, the higher the learning rate, the higher risk of overshooting (or never reaching) the minimum loss. There's a lot more factors at play that we cover in that series, but for now let's just consider the learning rate.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another aspect of learning rates is that a single value is rarely optimal for the duration of the training. We could say that its efficacy **degrades over time** (time measured in batches/epochs). That's why common techniques include decreasing the learning rate by a step-wise fixed amount or by an exponentially decreasing amount during the course of the training. The logic being that as the model is further into training and is approaching the minimum loss, it needs less pronounced updates (steps), and therefore would benefit from smaller increments.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Learning Rate Finder\n",
        "\n",
        "The **learning rate finder**, or more appropriately **learning rate _range_ finder**, is a method outlined in a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01186.pdf) by Leslie Smith written in 2015[^1]. The paper introduces the concept of **cyclical learning rates** (i.e. repeatedly cycling between learning rates inbetween a set minimum and a maximum has shown to be effective for training--a method we will implement from scratch in a future post!) whereby the minimum and maximum values to cycle through are found by a function that Leslie Smith defines as the \"_LR range test_\". Here's what the author himself has to say about it:\n",
        "\n",
        "> There is a simple way to estimate reasonable minimum\n",
        "and maximum boundary values with one training run of the\n",
        "network for a few epochs. It is a “LR range test”; run your\n",
        "model for several epochs while letting the learning rate increase linearly between low and high LR values. This test\n",
        "is enormously valuable whenever you are facing a new architecture or dataset.{% fn 1 %}\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "So where does the learning rate finder come into play? Well, it helps us find how learning rates affect our training loss, helping us spot a \"sweet spot\" of ranges that maximize the loss. That extremes of that range will also be  minimum and maximum values to use in the cyclical learning rates policy Leslie Smith outlines in his paper -- before we can implement cyclical learning rates, we need to implement a learning rate range finder!\n",
        "\n",
        "To give you an idea of what we're trying to create, let's see [fast.ai](https://fastai1.fast.ai/callbacks.lr_finder.html)'s implementation, probably one of the first frameworks to implement this LR range test. fast.ai offers a convenient helper function called the Learning Rate Finder (`Learner.lr_finder()`) that helps us see the effect a variety of learning rates have on our model's training performance as well as suggest a `min_grad_lr` where the gradient of the training loss is steepest:\n",

Rather than divide the learning rates linearly, which, when plotted on log scale, has the effect of condensing the majority of the learning rates towards the higher end, I opted to increment our step size exponentially.

        "\n",
        "As rules of thumb, fastai recommends picking the LR where the slope is steepest, or pick the end of the slop minimum and divide it by 10. In our case it seems our point of steepest slope is between $10^{-3}$ and $10^{-2}$. We definitely don't want to pick anything beyond 5e-1 as it seems the loss is flattening before picking up again. We also probably don't want to pick anything before $10^{-4}$ as the loss stays flat meaning it would take a lot of epochs before we see any significant improvement. If I were to pick a learning rate I would probably go with $10^{-2}$ for the first couple cycles, and then move to a finer one (e.g. $10^{-3}$).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "Learning rates are a critical part of training a neural network using SGD and a good learning rate will not only help you get closest to the minimum loss, but will also speed up your training (i.e. less epochs to reach a specific accuracy). \n",
        "\n",
        "Experiment with lr_finder yourself! Suggestions: try adding weights to our step_size increments (e.g. *2) and try incrementing it linearly instead of logarithmically and see how it affects the plot. \n",
        "\n",
        "If you have suggestions for what to implement next, comment below! Hope you found this useful and all the best in your machine learning journey. \n",
