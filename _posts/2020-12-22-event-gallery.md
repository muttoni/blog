# Events

Over the last couple years I spoke at A LOT of events (over 300+). That's what happens when you become a Technical Evangelist! I've been terrible at keeping track of photos from all the events, but will add as I come across them!

**Notable speaking engagements:** AWS re:Invent, Web Summit, IFA Berlin, Droidcon, Codemotion, Codetalks Hamburg, Cambridge University, Imperial College London, Euroconsumer, University College London, Alexa workshops in USA (Seattle), UK/IE (England, Ireland, Scotland), Germany (Berlin, Cologne, Frankfurt), Italy, Spain and hundreds more! .
