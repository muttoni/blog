It’s also part of the reason I haven’t posted since January. While I won’t reveal what it is just yet, it did allow me to experiment with the Jamstack (which I’m really liking). The “JAM” in Jamstack stands for JavaScript, APIs and Markdown. It’s a way to architect an application so that it can be decoupled from a central server, pre-rendered and therefore hosted anywhere as a static site. With Jamstack, the entire front end is prebuilt into static pages and assets during a build process. The big upside to this architecture is that sites can be served directly from a CDN, without a backend server…at all!</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://muttoni.github.io/blog/images/analytics.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://muttoni.github.io/blog/images/analytics.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">How to Ensure Consistent LightGBM Predictions in Production</title><link href="https://muttoni.github.io/blog/machine-learning/2021/01/22/Fixing-Inconsistent-LightGBM-Predictions-In-Production.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to Ensure Consistent LightGBM Predictions in Production" /><published>2021-01-22T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2021-01-22T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://muttoni.github.io/blog/machine-learning/2021/01/22/Fixing-Inconsistent-LightGBM-Predictions-In-Production</id><author><name>Andrea Muttoni</name></author><category term="machine-learning" /><summary type="html">Recently I’ve been working on productionizing a regression model to accurately estimate used car values. This was following a request from a friend who owns a car dealership and wants to know two things: 1) how much a customer’s car will be worth in 3-4 years when they trade it in for a new model, and 2) what’s the trade-in value now of a new customer’s used car. I was looking for a new project so I decided to help him out.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://muttoni.github.io/blog/images/pkl-meme.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://muttoni.github.io/blog/images/pkl-meme.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">The Tale of the Stochastic Markdown Bug</title><link href="https://muttoni.github.io/blog/misc/2021/01/19/The-Tale-Of-A-Markdown-Bug.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Tale of the Stochastic Markdown Bug" /><published>2021-01-19T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2021-01-19T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://muttoni.github.io/blog/misc/2021/01/19/The-Tale-Of-A-Markdown-Bug</id><author><name>Andrea Muttoni</name></author><category term="misc" /><summary type="html">I’ve recently started writing a blog as a way to “slow down” my learning and document things for my future self. Today I was typing out some quick notes for a blog post in markdown on VSCode and was making liberal use of subheadings, as one does when explaining a topic in a structured way. I like to type without distractions so I don’t preview things right away. Upon saving and previewing the post some headings simply did not render. I tried reloading multiple times, editing the spacing, ensuring there was 1 space between the hashtags and the words, anything I could think of. Here’s a condensed example of what the issue looked like:</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://muttoni.github.io/blog/images/md-preview.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://muttoni.github.io/blog/images/md-preview.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">AWS for Machine Learning Notes Part 1 - Streaming Real-Time Data with Kinesis</title><link href="https://muttoni.github.io/blog/machine-learning/aws/2021/01/18/AWS-for-Machine-Learning-Part-1-Kinesis.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="AWS for Machine Learning Notes Part 1 - Streaming Real-Time Data with Kinesis" /><published>2021-01-18T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2021-01-18T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://muttoni.github.io/blog/machine-learning/aws/2021/01/18/AWS-for-Machine-Learning-Part-1-Kinesis</id><author><name>Andrea Muttoni</name></author><category term="machine-learning" /><category term="aws" /><summary type="html">Over the next several months I will cover various AWS services in the context of Machine Learning. The goal is to summarize the main components and tools in a concise way (e.g. cliff notes), as well as show some hands-on examples. The main reason for doing this is I’m studying for the AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty Exam. In this first part, we will look at the start of any machine learning adventure: the data! In particular, how to deal with live, streaming data.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://muttoni.github.io/blog/images/aws/kinesis-architecture.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://muttoni.github.io/blog/images/aws/kinesis-architecture.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Implementing a Learning Rate Finder from Scratch</title><link href="https://muttoni.github.io/blog/machine-learning/2021/01/08/Implementing-a-Learning-Rate-Finder-from-Scratch.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Implementing a Learning Rate Finder from Scratch" /><published>2021-01-08T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2021-01-08T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://muttoni.github.io/blog/machine-learning/2021/01/08/Implementing-a-Learning-Rate-Finder-from-Scratch</id><author><name>Andrea Muttoni</name></author><category term="machine-learning" /><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://muttoni.github.io/blog/images/lrf-from-scratch.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://muttoni.github.io/blog/images/lrf-from-scratch.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
